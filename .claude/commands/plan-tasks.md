You MUST read and follow all directives in CLAUDE.md in the root directory.

Task: Create high-level completion strategy for project $ARGUMENTS, optimized for future Claude Code sessions.

Required reading:

- CLAUDE.md, README.md, TODO.md, project codebase

Process:

1. Analyze current state and identify completion gaps
2. THINK HARD and break work into actionable tasks with priorities/dependencies
3. Update documentation for future Claude efficiency

Documentation updates:
**README.md:** Project architecture, patterns, dependencies, current status
**TODO.md:** Self-contained tasks with acceptance criteria and technical context

Key principles:

- HIGH-LEVEL PLANNING ONLY - no detailed code specifications
- Write for Claude's pattern recognition and systematic execution
- Minimize ambiguity and re-analysis needs
- Include just enough technical context to prevent assumptions

Constraints:

- NEVER mark tasks complete
- NO code writing/modification
- Evidence-based planning only
- Focus on actionable task definitions

Completion:

- Ensure future Claude can immediately understand state and next steps
- Commit following CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Stop for review

Remember: High-level knowledge handoff to future self - optimize for immediate understanding and execution.
