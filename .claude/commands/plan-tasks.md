You MUST read and follow all directives in CLAUDE.md in the root directory.

Your task: Analyze and plan the completion strategy for project $ARGUMENTS, optimizing documentation for your future Claude Code sessions.

Required reading:

- CLAUDE.md (root directory directives)
- Current README.md (project state)
- Current TODO.md (existing tasks)
- All project code (for evidence-based planning)

Planning approach:

1. Analyze current project state and existing codebase
2. Identify gaps between current state and project completion
3. Break down remaining work into actionable tasks
4. Organize tasks by priority and dependencies
5. Update planning documents for maximum Claude Code efficiency

THINK HARD prior to updating the project files.

Documentation updates for future Claude sessions:
**README.md optimization:**

- Clear project architecture and component relationships
- Explicit coding patterns and conventions used
- Key dependencies and their purposes
- Current implementation status with specific details
- Context that future Claude sessions will need immediately

**TODO.md optimization:**

- Tasks written as clear, self-contained work units
- Explicit acceptance criteria for each task
- Technical context and reasoning for each task
- Priority levels and dependency relationships
- Enough detail that future Claude can start immediately without re-analysis

Self-optimization principles:

- Write for Claude Code's strengths (pattern recognition, systematic execution)
- Minimize ambiguity that could lead to re-work
- Include technical context that prevents incorrect assumptions
- Structure information for rapid consumption and decision-making
- Anticipate questions future Claude sessions might have

Key constraints:

- NEVER mark existing tasks as complete
- NO code writing or modification
- Base all planning on observable code evidence, not assumptions
- Document only what you can directly verify
- Focus on actionable, specific task definitions that minimize future analysis time

Completion:

- Ensure documentation serves as comprehensive guidance for future Claude Code sessions
- Validate that any future Claude could immediately understand project state and next steps
- Create a git commit following CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Stop and await review

Remember: You're creating a knowledge handoff to your future self. Optimize for immediate understanding and efficient execution.
