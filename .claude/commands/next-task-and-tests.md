You MUST read and follow all directives in CLAUDE.md in the root directory.

Your task: Complete the NEXT TASK for project $ARGUMENTS. THINK HARD and plan your work.

Required reading:

- CLAUDE.md (root directory directives)
- README.md (project overview)
- TODO.md (task context)

Approach:

1. Analyze the NEXT TASK requirements thoroughly
2. Create a flexible implementation plan that accounts for unknown scope
3. Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all code work:
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor as needed
4. Base all decisions on observable evidence, not assumptions

Documentation requirements:

- Only document what you can directly observe in the code
- Avoid speculative or assumed behavior
- Ground all explanations in concrete evidence

Completion:

- Create a git commit following CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Stop and await review

Remember: Plan for iteration and revision as scope becomes clearer through implementation.
