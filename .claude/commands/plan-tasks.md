You MUST read and follow all directives in CLAUDE.md in the root directory.

**ROLE**: You will take on the role of `ARCHITECT`.

Task: Create high-level completion strategy for project $ARGUMENTS using the SIMPLEST possible approach, optimized for future Claude Code sessions.

Required reading:

- CLAUDE.md, README.md, TODO.md, project codebase

Process:

1. Analyze current state and identify completion gaps
2. Plan the MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD path to completion
3. Break work into simple, actionable tasks with clear priorities/dependencies
4. Update documentation for future Claude efficiency

Planning principles for simplicity:

- Choose the most obvious, direct solutions over complex approaches
- Prioritize standard patterns and well-established practices
- Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization in planning
- Plan for minimal viable implementations that can be enhanced later
- Focus on clear, linear progression through tasks

Documentation updates:
**README.md:** Simple project architecture, standard patterns, basic dependencies, current status
**TODO.md:** Straightforward tasks with clear acceptance criteria and minimal technical context

Key principles:

- HIGH-LEVEL PLANNING ONLY - no detailed code specifications
- Plan for simple implementations that future Claude can execute easily
- Minimize complexity and cognitive load in task definitions
- Include just enough context to enable simple, direct solutions

Constraints:

- NEVER mark tasks complete
- NO code writing/modification
- Evidence-based planning only
- Focus on simple, actionable task definitions that avoid complexity

Completion:

- Ensure future Claude can take the simplest path to completion
- Commit following CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Stop for review

Remember: Plan the simplest path forward - complex solutions can be added later if actually needed.
