You MUST read and follow all directives in CLAUDE.md in the root directory.

Your task: Complete the NEXT TASK for project $ARGUMENTS using the SIMPLEST possible implementation.

Required reading:

- CLAUDE.md (root directory directives)
- README.md (project overview)
- TODO.md (task context)

Approach:

1. Analyze the NEXT TASK requirements thoroughly
2. Design the MINIMAL implementation that satisfies requirements
3. Prioritize simplicity over optimization or future-proofing
4. Ensure tests pass with straightforward, readable code
5. Base all decisions on observable evidence, not assumptions

Implementation principles:

- Choose the most obvious, direct solution
- Avoid premature optimization or complex patterns
- Use standard library functions over custom implementations
- Prefer explicit, clear code over clever solutions
- Implement only what's needed to make tests pass

Documentation requirements:

- Only document what you can directly observe in the code
- Avoid speculative or assumed behavior
- Ground all explanations in concrete evidence

Completion:

- Ensure all tests and linting pass
- Update TODO.md (mark current task complete, note any follow-up items)
- Create a singular git commit containing all changes following CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Stop and await review

Remember: Simple solutions are easier to understand, debug, and extend. Optimize for clarity and correctness over sophistication.
